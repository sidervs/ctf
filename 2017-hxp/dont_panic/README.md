# Write-up

This was a stripped golang binary, which is a mess.
When running the binary and entering some input, we get "Nope."
So, we can search for the string to get the main function.

Searching a sequence of bytes for "Nope." reveals:
!["Nope." search](1.png)

!["Nope." location](2.png)

Now, we can see where the bad-boy is. Close to it is the good-boy message.

![good/bad boy](3.png)

The flag is checked for length 42, and if it is that long - it is then checked byte by byte.

![byte check](5.png)

I didn't bother with the check as this is only a few thousands checks. Instead, I used gdb to break on the location of the bad-boy, checked the current index of the fail, and changed the flag accordingly.

gdb_script : 
```
b * 0x047BA23
commands
    printf "counter = %x\n\n", *(int *)($rsp+0x38)
    q
end
r
```
sol.py:
```
import subprocess

FILENAME = "./main_strip"
SPACE = ' '
COUNTER_STR ='counter = '
BAD_BOY = 'Nope.\n'
flag = list("hxp{"+SPACE*(42-5) +"}")

count = 4
count_old = 4
# Find all but 1 char
while count < len(flag)-2:
    r = subprocess.Popen(['gdb','-x','gdb_script','--args',FILENAME, ''.join(flag)], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output = r.communicate()
    counter_loc = output[0].find(COUNTER_STR)+len(COUNTER_STR)
    counter_end = output[0].find('\n', counter_loc+1)
    count = int(output[0][counter_loc:counter_end],16)
    if count != count_old:
        print "Got {0}, current flag ={1}".format(count, ''.join(flag))
        count_old = count
    flag[count] = chr(ord(flag[count])+1)

    output = r.communicate()
    if BAD_BOY == output[0]:

Seems like you got a flag...

hxp{k3eP_C4lM_AnD_D0n't_P4n1c__G0_i5_S4F3}
